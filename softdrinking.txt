//Objective to make toast.
n=3[friends]
k=4[bottles]
l=5[millimitres of drink]
c=10[limes]
d=8[lime slices]
p=100[grams of salt]
nl=3[millilitres to make a single toast]
np=1[grams of salt to make a single toast]

*Find k*l/nl
*Find c*d
*Find p/np
And then find the smallest among this three and then divide by the number of friends(n)
